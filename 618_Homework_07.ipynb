    "> The project consisted to evaluate different classification models to predict malicious and benign websites, based on application layer and network characteristics. The data were obtained by using different verified sources of benign and malicious URL's, in a low interactive client honeypot to isolate network traffic. We used additional tools to get other information, such as, server country with Whois."
